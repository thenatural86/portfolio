One visit to that website will have any users impressed by the amount of user interactivity it provides. This inspired the building of Potterless (the name implying it provides some Harry Potter fun but not any more than Pottermore) We wanted to put our newfound skills in Ruby on Rails to the test and create an engaging and themed experience that could (almost) rival or imitate what the Pottermore website does so successfully.",
